# Notes
You should treat software like hardware. If you want to work for a MNC company or if you want to be a CEO of an MNC compnay. Those companies' products are long term investments.
Once you make hardware, there is no unmaking it.

# Advices
You want HPC (High Performance Computing)?
You need to think highly efficiently. Otherwise, it is very difficult.
You want to make a physics engine?
You need to understand physics.
Chemists are good at computer science because computer science mostly relies on change. In chemistry, if something changes, it means something has happened.
Practice science on paper. It helps a lot.
You have books with unused pages?
You can use them instead of buying new ones. After use, you can sell them to a recycler.
You want to work on it, you work on it. I am doing this in my free time.
Use your head or heart. God did not give you that for no reason.
